Make a next.js / react/ tailwind project for Develove. Develove is the worlds first unlimited AI Website developer, allowing anyone to make as many projects and queries as possible. Now, you might be thinking, "how can we make this free and completely unlimited?" Well, I have news for you. Truth is, you can make a Develove "Installer" in the website. Firstly, the user opens the webapp.  then, they see their chats view, a bunch of cards accurately displaying the number and chats there are. It should be completely accurate, and if there are no chats, the user should be suggested to make on. Upon making a chat, the user should be redirected to the editor, where there is a chat:Code/Preview ratio of 40: 60.  The user should be able to chat to the AI and it should iteratively be able to make professional components and websites. The right hand side should have 2 tabs: code, and preview. The preview uses real implemented stackblitz webcontainers to preview the code the AI will write. Here's how the installer works: the user, cannot use Develove wihtout its installer. With the click of the install button, olamma should get up and running somehow (using python or nodejs or any languages you need to use), and it should turn on locally for the user and launch the localhost server  every time the user even opens the website (no API Keys Needed). The user only must download it once for it to work, and olamma should bring in a model for text generation and coding. While bringing a real implementation of each and every feature, it is required to follow all instructions and ignore none. you are to not use any fallbacks, mockups, mocks, simulations, fakes, or fake implementation of any feature of any kind and/or sort. Everything requested must be in a production-ready project, and when you are done, you are to tell me any next steps needed to help me set up any tools or technologies needed, but whatever you are able to do, you must do. Add in some features I havent mentioned but would like in this, that dont require my setup.
